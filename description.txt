The GPT-NEO model has been finetuned on english tweets from November 15th, 2021 to January 27th, 2022 which included the keywords *denmark* and one of the three keywords *covid*, *corona*, or *omicron*. 
The polarity of the tweets have been classified using the [pysentimiento](https://github.com/pysentimiento/pysentimiento) model.
Using only the tweets with one of the three polarity labels (i.e., negative, neutral, positive) the GPT-NEO has been finetuned resulting in three different generative models.

**How to use the app**

In the sidebar you can choose which of the three models you want to use. 
Then you choose a prompt. 
You can either choose a predefined prompt and it will show 20 tweets, which have already been generated.
Otherwise, you can make your own prompt by selecting 'Custom prompt'. Note that generating your own tweet might take a few seconds.
